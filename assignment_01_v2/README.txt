Assignment 01, tests and runs a simple test program for a basic array class (fixed size, 100 ints)

Note: this is the second implementation, uses test code from assignment_02. For a much more complex
version (that may end up fetching + rebuilding itself + dependencies from the internet), see assignment_01.

Build instructions:
    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ..; make test; make run
